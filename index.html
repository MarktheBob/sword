            <p>Many millenia ago the first human picked up a stick and used it to establish a tribe, becoming its leader. A sharp stone was used to hunt, gradually evolving into the first sword, a weapon that started shaping the world. From stone to bronze, iron to steel, the sword evolved, becoming better at the task of defending and attacking tribes and empires. This weapon is paramount to the existance of today's world and will forever be prominant in our culture.</p>
